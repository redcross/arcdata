Log of changes to DCSOps sites.

  PROD == production site (dcsops.org; runs at Heroku)
  STAG == staging site    (not yet set up as of 2017-11-22)

Please put the label "RECOVERY" in the first line of an item that is
about recovery from downtime or from other functionality disruptions.
E.g., "[2018-02-01] PROD: RECOVERY from downtime due to DB upgrade".
That way we can easily find and study unusual incidents.

* [2018-12-20] PROD: master:bc002e2

  Deploy pull request #180, updating DAT incident labels.

* [2018-12-06] PROD: master:cb79b7a

  Deploy pull request #179, fixing county param in dispatch intake form.

* [2018-10-26] PROD: RECOVERY master:e315227 SSO login issues

  After the main Red Cross SSO server updated its SSL certificates (due
  to Symantec certificates no longer being supported in Chrome) users of
  DCSOps were no longer able to log in with Red Cross SSO. After attempting
  to modify the certificates in config/ca/ without resolving the error,
  allowing TLS to be negotiated without specified certificates fixed the
  issue.

* [2018-08-08] PROD: RECOVERY master:12ccb58 Direct Line outage issues

  Inbound emails from Direct Line predominantly, but not exclusively,
  for the Cascades region were not being processed. This was caused by
  geocode_incident in the dispatch importer not adding the required
  territory field to incidents when receiving an error from the Google
  geocoder. Moving the adding of a territory to an ensure block
  resolved the issue.

* [2018-08-01] PROD: RECOVERY NCCR Chapter Direct Line outage

  Inbound emails from Direct Line for NCCR were not being processed
  and returning a HTTP 422 code at the /import path. This was caused
  by incident numbers from several years ago overlapping with the new
  set of incident numbers coming in. The older incidents starting with
  "19-" (the prefix at the time) were changed to start with "13-" which
  resolved the error.

* [2018-06-15] PROD: Remove Heroku SSL Endpoint add-on

  Now that the site is using Heroku SSL through Let's Encrypt rather
  than the static endpoint add-on, we were able to remove this after
  migrating all of the endpoints to point to their respective
  herokudns.com domains.

* [2018-06-02] PROD: RECOVERY Domain SSL updates, Google API fix

  An SSL certificate expired, and because Heroku no longer permits the
  manual creation of Let's Encrypt certificates (since they use them
  internally) and also because we didn't have access to the DNS to be
  able to use Heroku's SSL, we needed to update the redirect to the
  Heroku domain (arcdata.herokuapp.com) so that HTTPS was preserved.
  We then purchased a new domain (datresponse.org), set up the DNS,
  and set it up with Heroku SSL.

  Additionally, Google APIs stopped working (potentially related to the
  domain change), which prevented the creation of new issues because of
  a setting disallowing the manual entry of addresses. We updated the
  Google Maps API script URL to include an updated API key which
  resolved the issues.

* [2018-05-28] STAGING: staging-environment:f4d5a84 Create staging environment

  Setup the initial staging environment with a copy of the production
  database with some unnecessary records removed.

* [2018-02-26] PROD: RECOVERY Incident import unique ID errors

  During the database migration it looks like import_logs_id_seq was
  changed to job_logs_id_seq (likely due to loading the schema rather
  than migrating), but more importantly its value was restarted. This
  caused unique PK errors. We initially implemented exception handling
  for this exception, and then after figuring out the cause, increased
  the last_value in job_logs_id_seq and reverted that commit (b71306a).

* [2018-02-21] PROD: RECOVERY master:f32b7fe Infinite loop outage recovery

  Delayed jobs being run in background threads were taking up all
  of the usable memory on dynos. We moved all delayed jobs to a worker
  dyno and fixed the infinite loop bug.

* [2018-02-19] PROD: RECOVERY Twilio credential update

  SMS messages through Twilio weren't being sent because the account being
  used for all chapters was changed. Twilio credentials are managed on a per-
  chapter basis, so we needed to update them for all chapters. The auth token
  was also rotated after the initial rotation because it was exposed briefly on
  GitHub.

* [2018-02-06] PROD: Re-add indexes and constrains to DB after resizing

  Indexes and constraints from the larger database weren't maintained in
  the migration, so those were re-added to fix issue #150.

* [2018-02-01] PROD: RECOVERY from downtime during DB resizing
  See [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dcsops-dev/nEI_PQ8G9_8]["Database Outage Initial Post-Mortem"]] on the DCSOps Dev Forum.

  The two main new checklist items from that experience are summarized
  in [[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/dcsops-dev/nEI_PQ8G9_8/3NfFwqAtBQAJ][this message]]:

    1) Always rehearse locally, even if it makes the whole process
       take more time.
  
    2) Preserve resources needed for rollback until at least 72 hours
       after the change, and then only after receiving some
       confirmation from multiple testers/users that the changed
       system is working as expected.

  I'm not sure where to document those yet -- ../INSTALL.md, maybe?
  Anyway, for now they go in here so we don't lose them, but they
  should go into administrative documentation.
* [2018-02-01] PROD: (infrastructure change, no associated commit)

  Delete inactive databases (color codes, aqua, jade, and olive) to reduce heroku bill. Move data from previous active database (color code black, plan premium-0) into a new smaller db (color code olive, plan standard-0; this is not the same as the previous olive db, the names are just a coincidence). Backups of all 4 old databases have been captured and saved on 2 local machines. Storing them somewhere more accessible is pending approval.

* [2018-02-01] PROD: master:c48c6e7

  Deploy pull request #147, adding empty apple-touch-icon assets to stop 404 responses

* [2018-01-09] PROD: master:eb2b81e

  Deployed pull requests #125, #137 allowing PubNub to use SSL and
  fixing some errors with the admin site.

* [2018-01-06] PROD: master:d50908b

  Deployed pull request #135, submitting Volunteer Connection hours
  in groups of at most 40 at a time.

* [2018-01-05] PROD: master:0462d7c

  Deployed pull request #134, bringing Heroku up to the tip of master
  and fixing a bug in the import script.

* [2018-01-05] PROD: master:20c2437

  Deployed pull requests #109, #131, and #132 for multiple patches
  bringing Heroku up to the tip of the master branch. Also updated the
  BOUNDARY_TABLE_ID config variable in Heroku to the updated Fusion
  Table ID mentioned in PR #131.

* [2017-12-28] PROD: master:cc3cd2c

  Deployed pull request #127 to update minor versions of multiple
  gems, bringing Heroku up to the tip of the master branch. Then
  merged the 'rails-update' branches of the two forked dependencies
  into their respective master branches and updated them in the Gemfile.

* [2017-12-26] PROD

  Multiple steps were taken to try and figure out why outages were
  occurring. The hourly rake task in Heroku Scheduler was disabled
  and then re-enabled, and the Periscope username was changed to the
  current value with "_NULL" added to invalidate the connection and
  then it was/will be changed back.

* [2017-11-29] PROD: master:2e4a871

  Deployed pull request #114 to reduce the number of lines logged
  during import.

* [2017-11-29] PROD

  Updated all database credentials with the command:

  $ heroku pg:credentials HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BLACK --reset -a arcdata

  Substitute AQUA, JADE, and OLIVE for those databases respectively.
  The Heroku CLI gives a warning about how the '--reset' flag is being
  deprecated in favor of using 'heroku pg:credentials:rotate', but that
  'rotate' is only supported on Postgres 9.6.

  Created issue #122 to track updating Postgres. More information on
  rotating Heroku credentials is here:
  https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql-credentials

* [2017-11-28] PROD: master:5076e49

  Deployed pull request #115 to include RCO ID in admin site results.

* [2017-11-28] PROD: master:2e6b8d4

  Tested a trivial deployment out with only documentation changes to
  make sure everything is working (related to issue #118). Brought
  the Heroku production site to the tip of 'master'. Deployment is
  managed through Heroku, and can be triggered with the command:

  $ git push heroku master

* [2017-11-15] PROD: master:24a773e3
  Todd Eichel brought the Heroku production site to commit 24a773e3
  (tip of 'master' branch at that time), as confirmed in this email:
